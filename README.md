# CMPG323-Project-5

During this project I will be aiming to learn as much as I can about Power BI and data visualisation.
During the first phase of the project, I tried making a live connection to the sharepoint excel sheet, but due to some unknown problems I could not get an answer for on any forums I was not able to do so. 
I did some research regarding the best practices to layout of pages and alt text, and tried to apply that as best I could.
I implemented key measures to do some calculations regarding unused zones and categories.
